# CaucusReport

The "Caucus Report" app is available in the iOS App Store for iPhone only.  US Store only.  In the interests of election transparency I am also making it #OpenSource.

The "Caucus Report" app allows Nevada Democratic Caucus Goers to input vote totals, calculate viability threshold, calculate delegates, and Tweet unofficial results.

Voting information is entered in five phases:

1) Precinct information, including the number of delegates, early voters, and attendee voters.
2) Early vote totals for alignment 1
3) Attendee vote totals for alignment 1

At this point, the "Caucus Report" allows the user to generate a Tweet with alignment 1 results.

4) Early vote totals for alignment 2.
5) Attendee vote totals for alignment 2

At this point, the "Caucus Report" calculates delegates and indicates whether any "coin tosses" are required to break ties.  The user may Tweet unofficial results.

Sending a Tweet requires the user to have a Twitter account and the Twitter application on their iPhone.  Your Twitter information is _not_ shared with "Caucus Report".  Any Tweets generated from "Caucus Report" are sent as a draft to your Twitter application.  You can review the Tweet before sending.

Viability and delegate calculations are performed as per the instructions at https://nvdems.com/delegate-selection-and-caucus-materials/ website.

This application is not associated with the Nevada Democratic Party.  All results are unofficial.  Any use of this app by election personnel should be verified by a second means of calculation.
